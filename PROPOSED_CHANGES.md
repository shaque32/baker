# Proposed changes to frozen files

Agents write here instead of editing `core/contracts.py`, `core/schema.sql`,
`core/audit/rules.py`, prompts or gold data. A human reviews each entry and applies it on `main`.

Format for each entry:

```
## <date> <branch>: <one-line summary>
File: <frozen file>
Why: <what you could not do without it>
Diff:
<exact change>
```

(no entries yet)
